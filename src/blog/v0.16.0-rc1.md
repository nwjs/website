NW.js 0.16.0-rc1 is released in Beta branch with latest Chromium beta 52.0.2743.73. This version introduces CSS containment, simpler performance measurement, streamable responses from service workers, and more options for web push. Node.js is updated to latest 6.3.0. This version includes many bug fixes since 0.15.4. Because Chromium 52 and NW 0.16.0 will be released soon, there will not be more releases in 0.15 branch.

See upstream blog for exciting new features and improvements in Chromium 52: http://blog.chromium.org/2016/06/chrome-52-beta-css-containment-simpler.html

Following our release plan in 2016, we want to release a new major version as soon as a new Chromium stable release. That means 0.16.0 should be released soon after Chromium 52 released as stable version, which is expected to happen in mid July. So 0.16.0 testing versions are released now for preview and test purpose. Please try it and give your valuable feedback.

We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
