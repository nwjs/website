NW 0.102.1 is released with Node.js v24.5.0.

In NW v0.102, Chromium 139 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **new CSS features, async attribute for SVG script elements, On-device Web Speech API** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-139-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 139 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=139).

I've made the 0.102 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 139. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
