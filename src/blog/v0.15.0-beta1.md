We're pleased to announce NW.js 0.15.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 51.0.2704.22 and Node.js v6.0 contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore. See the upstream announcement for more information: http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2016/04/beta-channel-update_21.html  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v6.0.0

See also the exciting new JS language features in v8 engine v5.1 in this release: http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/04/v8-release-51.html

We've made the 0.15 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 51, and with Node.js v6.0.0 released yesterday, the beta1 release is now ready. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable; and a beta branch on Chromium beta. The beta branch contains all the fixes committed to the stable branch.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.

Binary for other platforms: http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.15.0-beta1/ 

There are 2 builds for each platform - normal build, and SDK build. Normal build doesn't have devtools, only SDK build does. lt can be opened by pressing F12 (Cmd-Alt-I on OSX). SDK packages also have more development tools to be exposed in the following releases, as well as the NaCl support. The NaCl build flavor in 0.14 and 0.13 was dropped due to [very low usage and feedback](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nwjs-general/uyNwqEPowd0/RfIDu1EIBQAJ)

Our build infrastructure enables live binary build from git tip so you can access to the latest binary from http://dl.nwjs.io/live-build/
