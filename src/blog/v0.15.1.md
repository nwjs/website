NW.js 0.15.1 is here with today's Chromium stable 51 update, new Custom Printing API and bug fixes. The custom printing API lets you print the web contents with many options without the need for user's interaction in the print preview UI. Currently the options supported are printer destination, media size, orientation, PDF output, CSS background removal and header/footer removal. See [the documentation](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/nw14/References/Window/#winprintoptions) for more information.

Another new feature is to specify the hostname of the chrome-extension protocol URL for your application. A new field `domain` is added to the manifest and the value will be used as the hostname of the application. Previously the hostname was generated from the `name` field of the manifest. Once it's enabled, the web engine will share the same cookies between your application and the website under the same domain.

In Chrome 51 upstream introduced support for **passive event listeners** and **Intersection Observer**, two emerging web standards that help developers create engaging, efficient experiences. See blog [New APIs to help developers improve scroll performance in Chromium 51](http://blog.chromium.org/2016/05/new-apis-to-help-developers-improve.html) for these 2 features. See also more exciting new features and improvements in Chromium 51: http://blog.chromium.org/2016/04/chrome-51-beta-credential-management.html ;

Following our release plan in 2016, we have released new major versions as soon as new Chromium stable release within 1 day. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.

Binaries for other platforms: http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.15.1/ 

There are 2 builds for each platform - normal build, and SDK build. Normal build doesn't have devtools, only SDK build does. lt can be opened by pressing F12 (Cmd-Alt-I on OSX). SDK packages also have more development tools to be exposed in the following releases, as well as the NaCl support. The NaCl build flavor in 0.14 and 0.13 was dropped due to [very low usage and feedback](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nwjs-general/uyNwqEPowd0/RfIDu1EIBQAJ)

Our build infrastructure enables live binary build from git tip so you can access to the latest binary from http://dl.nwjs.io/live-build/
