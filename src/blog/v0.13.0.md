We are delighted to announce NW.js 0.13.0, which is a milestone in the project development. It's based on an adjusted architecture and bring the benefit of enabling most features in the Chromium browser, including Chrome Apps support, chrome.* platform APIs, NaCl and Pepper plugin, builtin PDF viewer, printing preview, rich notifications and many more. We also expect faster release cycle with the new architecture in 2016.

In this version Chromium is updated to 49.0.2623.87 and Node.js is updated to 5.9.0. Both are at the latest stable. Our target is to release a new major version soon after every Chromium stable release unless blocking by v8 API mismatch between Node and Chromium.

We also changed the API to put everything from the ‘nw.gui’ library into the ‘nw’ object. To provide API compatibility with 0.12 applications, we evaluate a builtin shim script at window context creation. It simulates the API  provided by 'require('nw.gui')'. 

Starting from this version, the official documentation is maintained in the same repo we use for development, and is available in http://docs.nwjs.io . Welcome to submit PR for it. Documents for the previous versions will be in the wiki as usual.

There are many new features. Please see [our blog post](whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
