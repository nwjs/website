NW 0.101.1 is released with Node.js v24.3.0. In this release, a new command line argument `--node-options` is added. You can put Node.js command line options as its value. Before this version, the only way to add Node.js options is the `node-main` field in manifest.

A new Node.js option `--nw-stdin` is also add in this release. It redirects the browser process stdio to the web engine's JavaScript context. This would allow an NW.js application to be used in shell pipelines and behave more like a standard command-line executable, which could be useful for scripting and automation. It redirects the stdio in the Chromium browser process to the Node.js residing in the Web engine so using it will feel more like using Node.js from terminal, plus you can call all the nw.* and DOM APIs from there. To enable it, use command line argument `--node-options=--nw-stdin`. Only Linux supports this feature for now.

In NW v0.101, Chromium 138 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **new CSS features, video frame orientation metadata to WebCodecs** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-138-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 138 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=138).

I've made the 0.101 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 138. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
