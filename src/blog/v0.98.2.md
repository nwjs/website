title: NW.js v0.98.2 Released with ESM Support in Node

I'm pleased to announce NW 0.98.2 with ECMAScript module support in Node. By adding a switch '--enable-features=NWESM', those modules can be loaded in Node context via 'import'.

Besides that, ES modules from Node can also be loaded directly in DOM contexts just like calling require(). The Node.js module resolver and the one from Browser are chained together to achieve this. To turn on this feature, use --enable-features=NWChainImportNode (under which the Node resolver is called first) or --enable-features=NWChainImportDom. These 2 flags should be used together with NWESM e.g. --enable-features=NWESM,NWChainImportNode

In NW v0.98, Chromium 135 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **new CSS features, Dispatching click events to captured pointer, The fetchLater API** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-135-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 135 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=135).

I've made the 0.98 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 135. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
