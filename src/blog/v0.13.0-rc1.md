We are excited to announce NW.js 0.13.0-rc1. Chromium is updated to latest stable version 49, which is just announced in upstream (49.0.2623.75); Node.js is updated to 5.7.0.

The update to Chromium 49 features CSS custom properties, background sync with service workers, improved ECMAScript 2015 support and more, see http://blog.chromium.org/2016/02/chrome-49-beta-css-custom-properties.html

A new method 'registerStream()' is added to 'nw.Screen.DesktopCaptureMonitor', so video conference applications are able to launch video chat in getUserMedia() without blocking on user's input. See the docs for more information: http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/References/Screen/#screendesktopcapturemonitorregisterstreamid

RC1 focuss on the rebase to Chromium 49 and Node 5.7.0. We'll continue to fix reported issues. The final version of 0.13.0 is expected to be released within Chromium 49 lifetime (before Chromium 50 release). For the plan of the upcoming 0.13 final release, see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nwjs-general/g1OkxHl4XYs/x83fxvnbAQAJ
