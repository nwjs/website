I'm pleased to announce NW 0.100.1 with Node v24 upgrade. This release also fixes the inspector module in Node.

A switch `--nw-node-inspector` is needed in `node-main` in `package.json` to enable the V8 inspector in Node. Note that this will replace the registered V8 inspector in DOM from Blink, which will in turn breaks `console.log` in DOM since it relies on the inspector. You should consider use the `console` from Node instead as a workaround. This issue would be addressed in future releases.

In NW v0.100, Chromium 137 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **CSS if function, JavaScript Promise Integration, transform attribute on SVG Element** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-137-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 137 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=137).

I've made the 0.100 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 137. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
