We're glad to release NW.js 0.13.3. It includes a feature to disable requestAnimationFrame throttling when window is minimized or hidden; Node.js is updated to 5.10.0; and some fixes we made during these days.

A new command line argument '--disable-raf-throttling' is introduced. When it's used, requestAnimationFrame callback will continue to fire when window is minimized or hidden. It's pretty useful for game developer. When the argument is not used, it behaves in the same way as Chrome browser and has no side effects.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
