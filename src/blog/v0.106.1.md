We are pleased to announce the release of NW.js v0.106.1. This release brings significant updates to the underlying engine and improved support for Windows on Arm.

### Key Updates

* **Node.js**: Updated to v25.2.1
* **Chromium**: Updated to the latest stable version 143

### Windows on Arm Performance & Support

We would like to extend a special thank you to **Orina Zhang** and the **Microsoft App Assure team** for their collaboration and support. They assisted in testing and verifying the experimental builds of NW.js on Windows on Arm (WoA).

Their extensive internal testing confirmed that the native NW.js win/arm64 binary works well and demonstrates superior performance compared to the x64 binary running on Arm hardware.

**Benchmark Highlights:**
According to the performance results shared by the Microsoft team:

* 
**NW.js Performance:** The native Arm64 build showed a **36.42% (median)** performance improvement compared to the x64 build on Windows on Arm.


* 
**Node.js Performance:** In pure Node.js benchmarks, the Arm64 build demonstrated a median improvement of **174.23%** over the x64 version on the same hardware.

Significant gains were observed in CPU-intensive tasks such as prime number calculations and array manipulations.

We recommend developers targeting Windows on Arm devices to utilize the `win-arm64` build to take full advantage of these performance improvements.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
