NW 0.101.2 is released with Chromium 138.0.7204.97 security update. Google Chrome has recently released security updates to address a high-severity vulnerability that was actively being exploited in the wild. The zero-day vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-6554, has been described as a type confusing flaw in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine.

"Type confusion in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 138.0.7204.96 allowed a remote attacker to perform arbitrary read/write via a crafted HTML page," according to a description of the bug on the NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

In NW v0.101, Chromium 138 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **new CSS features, video frame orientation metadata to WebCodecs** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-138-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 138 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=138).

I've made the 0.101 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 138. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
