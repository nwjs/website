We are excited to release NW.js 0.14.0 with latest Chromium stable 50.0.2661.75.

See upstream blog for exciting new features and improvements in Chromium 50: http://blog.chromium.org/2016/03/chrome-50-beta-push-notification.html

Following our release plan in 2016, we want to release a new major version as soon as a new Chromium stable release. After 3 RC versions in the beta branch for 0.14 with Chromium 50, we make the final version available within 24 hours following upstream relase. Thanks to all the users reporting issues and feedback.

We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable; and a beta branch on Chromium beta. In the past 0.13.x and 0.14.0-rc releases, as soon as an version is available in upstream, we released the updated NW.js within 24 hours. This is helpful to deliver new features and security fixes to users in time.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions which has an optimized architecture, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
