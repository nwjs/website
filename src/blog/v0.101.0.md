I'm pleased to announce NW 0.101.0 with Chromium 138 stable upgrade. Per upstream, Chromium 138 is the final release of Chromium to support macOS 11. M139 will require at least macOS 12.

In NW v0.101, Chromium 138 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **new CSS features, video frame orientation metadata to WebCodecs** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-138-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 138 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=138).

I've made the 0.101 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 138. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
