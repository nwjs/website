# {{{title}}}

We are pleased to announce NW.js 0.13.0-beta3. After the beta announcement,
thanks to the bug reports from many users, we have been fixing the issues and
release a new version now. We'll keep watching issue reports and release new versions
regularly. Hopefully we can reach RC state after a month. beta3 is a bug fix release
with no new features or upstream updates. In the next beta version Chromium will be
updated to 48 and Node.js will be updated too.

have more development tools to be exposed in the following releases, 
as well as the NaCl support.
