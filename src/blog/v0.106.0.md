I'm pleased to announce NW 0.106.0 with Chromium 143. Node.js is updated to v25, and Win ARM64 build is supported.

In NW v0.106, Chromium 143 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **more characters in JavaScript DOM APIs, CSS anchored fallback container queries** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-143-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 143 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=143).

I've made the 0.106 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 143. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
