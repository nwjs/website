NW.js 0.14.1 is released with bug fixes, including the one for Menu regression.

Previously we released 0.14.0 with latest Chromium stable 50 in less than 1 day after upstream release. This is helpful to deliver new features and security fixes to users in time. See upstream blog for exciting new features and improvements in Chromium 50: http://blog.chromium.org/2016/03/chrome-50-beta-push-notification.html

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions which has an optimized architecture, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
