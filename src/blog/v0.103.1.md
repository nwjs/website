I'm pleased to announce NW 0.103.1 with Node.js v24.7.0. The Chromium engine is updated as well.

In NW v0.103, Chromium 140 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **nested view transitions, Controlled Frame API, Http cookie prefix** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-140-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 140 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=140).

I've made the 0.103 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 140. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
