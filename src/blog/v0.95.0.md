I'm pleased to announce NW v0.95.0 with Chromium 132 stable upgrade.

In NW v0.95, Chromium 132 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **new CSS features, Capture all screens, Element Capture** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-132-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 132 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=132).

I've made the 0.95 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 132. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
