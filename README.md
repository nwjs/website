### What you can contribute to this project:

* If you have i18n experience, we'd love the project be converted to use JSON based translation files.
* The site could be optimized with tools like Grunt or Gulp to automate concat/minify/uglify JS.
* Middle-Tier API stuff! Right now we are manually updating the `api.json` and `config.json` files. This process could obviously be improved.
* Graphics work. Whoever created the original design didn't put the source files (PSD/AI) into the repo making updates and optimization difficult.
* Once hooked up properly using a CNAME and proper repo naming convention, the pages can be altered to use root level linking of files which will fix some fringe cases on the 404 router.
* Adding additional pages like:
 * "Showcase" or "Spotlight" to show apps that have been made with NW.js
 * "Tutorials" or "References" for links to NW.js specific videos, blogs, books, libraries, and frameworks.
 * "About" page. A few paragraphs about the people working on the project.
 * "History" page. A full history of the project, how it started and all the changes it's gone through along the way.
 * Hosted documentation. Rather than linking directly to the GitHub Wiki. We could put the most important FAQ's on the site, or find a way to use GitHub's API to pull in the wiki content and put it on the site dynamically.
* Explainer Video. This may do wonders to highlight exactly what NW.js is and how it's used for people who are coming to the site and just hearing about the project.
* Redesign of the Features section on the homepage. This area just feels like it could be improved.
* Redesign of the downloads sections of the homepage to highlight and focus on the download that is relevent to the user.
